The purpose of this project is to conduct Unit Testing using PyTest on a previous Python project of mine named 'Pythons & Ladders' to practise QA Analysis skills. The previous project contained beginner-level Python code with a lack of functions; the code has been refactored to be modular, clean and testable. The previous version will still be available on my GitHub to showcase the differences.
