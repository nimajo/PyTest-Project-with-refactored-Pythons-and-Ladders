The purpose of this project is to conduct Unit Testing using PyTest on a previous Python project of mine named 'Pythons & Ladders' with the purpose of practising QA Analysis skills. The previous project contained beginner level python code with a lack of functions, the code has been refactored to be clean and testable. The previous version will still be available on my GitHub to showcase the differences.
