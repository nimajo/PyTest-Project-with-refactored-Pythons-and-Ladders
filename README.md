The purpose of this project is to conduct Unit Testing using PyTest on a previous Python project of mine named 'Pythons & Ladders' to practise QA Analysis skills. The previous project contained beginner-level Python code with a lack of functions; the code has been refactored to be modular, clean and testable. The previous version will still be available on my GitHub to showcase the differences.

To run the board game, please use 'main.py'.
